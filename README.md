## Hi there 👋

💻 I’m a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** passionate about building scalable, automated, and secure cloud infrastructures.  
With hands-on experience in **AWS, Linux, Docker, and CI/CD tools**, I focus on streamlining deployments, optimizing performance, and ensuring system reliability.  
I enjoy designing end-to-end cloud solutions, writing automation scripts, and leveraging monitoring tools to maintain production-grade environments.  
Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I aim to bridge the gap between development and operations — improving speed, stability, and efficiency across the delivery pipeline.
