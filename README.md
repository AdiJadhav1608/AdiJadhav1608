## Hi there 👋

💻 Cloud & DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Git, and CI/CD automation. I design and manage scalable cloud infrastructure, containerize applications, and deploy reliable microservices using best DevOps practices.

I specialize in Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, building automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and maintaining high code quality with Maven and SonarQube. I focus on improving deployment speed, system reliability, and operational efficiency through automation.

Passionate about cloud-native technologies, monitoring, and observability using Datadog and AWS CloudWatch. I enjoy solving real-world problems, collaborating with teams, and continuously learning to build secure, scalable, and production-ready systems.

🚀 Actively seeking Cloud, DevOps, or SRE opportunities to contribute, grow, and deliver impactful solutions.
